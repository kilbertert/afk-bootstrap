# TASK

Implement issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

You are on branch `{{BRANCH}}`, already created from `main`. Pull in the
issue with `gh issue view {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --comments`. If it has a
parent PRD, pull that in too.

# CONTEXT

Read `.sandcastle/REPO-MAP.md` first (where things live), then `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/`,
`.sandcastle/CODING_STANDARDS.md`, and any relevant ADRs under
`docs/adr/` before starting. Explore the repo and fill your context with the parts
relevant to this issue — especially test files that touch the area
you'll change.
Run the Economy ladder before choosing an implementation; stop at the first
option that fully satisfies the issue and its acceptance contract.

# EXECUTION

Use red-green-refactor where applicable.

1. RED: write one failing test
2. GREEN: implement to pass it
3. REPEAT until the issue is done
4. REFACTOR

Before committing, run `npm run check`, then
`node .sandcastle/policy-check.mjs commit`.

If the repo has a project verification skill — a directory matching
`.claude/skills/verify-*/` — and your change alters behavior a user can see,
run that skill and capture its evidence too. Tests are not a substitute: it
drives the real app the way a user does. The skill's own evidence is usually
gitignored, so put what you rely on somewhere the commit carries. If you cannot
run it, say so and why in the commit body; do not report it as done.

# COMMIT

Make one or more git commits on `{{BRANCH}}`. Use conventional-commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`). Do NOT use a `RALPH:` prefix — that prefix is reserved for the RALPH loop.

Do not close the issue yourself.
