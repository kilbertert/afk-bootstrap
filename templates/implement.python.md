# AFK implementation

Implement exactly GitHub issue {{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}.

Read `.sandcastle/REPO-MAP.md` first (where things live), then `GLOSSARY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, the issue, `docs/`, `.sandcastle/CODING_STANDARDS.md`, and the smallest set of relevant source
and tests before editing. Work on one issue only.
Run the Economy ladder defined in the coding standards before choosing an
implementation; stop at the first option that fully satisfies the issue.

Requirements:

1. Preserve the project's existing contracts and fail-closed guarantees. Do
   not invent a parallel runtime contract.
2. Make the smallest coherent change and add or update focused tests for
   behavior you change.
3. Run `uv sync --extra dev && uv run pytest && uv run ruff check` before
   committing. Do not weaken or skip checks.
4. If the repo has a project verification skill — a directory matching
   `.claude/skills/verify-*/` — and your change alters behavior a user can
   see, run that skill and capture its evidence before committing. Tests are
   not a substitute: it drives the real app the way a user does. If you cannot
   run it, say so and why in the commit body; do not report it as done.
5. If your change alters the repository's shape — a new top-level directory, a
   new test suite, a moved entry point — regenerate the map so CI stays green:
   `node .sandcastle/repo-map.mjs`. The policy job fails on a stale map, and the
   failure names the command, but regenerating it is yours to do.
6. Run `node .sandcastle/policy-check.mjs commit` before committing.

If this change settles something a later reader would otherwise have to
re-derive — a user-visible behavior, a cross-file contract, an auth boundary, a
format, a delivery or test-strategy decision — write or update the record in
`docs/adr/` **in this same commit**. `docs/agents/architecture-decisions.md`
says what counts and what does not; the short version is that most changes owe
nothing. If nothing is owed, one line in the commit body settles it:

    No-ADR: <why not>

7. Inspect `git diff --check` and the changed-file list before committing.
8. Commit the completed work with a Conventional Commit message.

If the issue is complete, print `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` after the commit.
If a required human decision, credential, or external environment is missing,
do not guess; explain the blocker and print `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>`.

Do not merge, push, close issues, or modify GitHub state from inside the
container. The host runner owns delivery.
